# Security

Child Mind Institute values the security of our users, data, and servers. We take the security of our systems seriously and encourage users to report any suspected security vulnerabilities promptly.

## Supported Versions

The Cross Species Mapper will always run the latest version of the main branch. Any other version is not supported.

## Reporting Vulnerabilities

To report security vulnerabilities, please do NOT use our issues page. Instead, kindly email us at reinder.vosdewael@childmind.org. Please refrain from using other communication channels.

For non-security-related issues, we welcome your input and feedback on our issues page. Feel free to share your ideas and suggestions to help us improve our services.
